ðŸš¢Titanic_Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)


This project was completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, focusing on exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing using the Titanic dataset. The task was to explore the dataset, identify key patterns, and clean the data to make it suitable for future machine learning applications.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The main goals of this project were to:

Understand the structure and distribution of key features in the dataset

Detect and handle missing values

Visualize important trends (e.g., survival by gender, class, etc.)
